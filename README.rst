OndaNet
=======
My purpouse is to learn Data Analysis and Data Mining using data from Onda Rock,
an Italian music portal.

Step 1: A network of the music
--------------------------------------
Each review page of Ondarock is conneted with the other
using hyperlink. I would obtain the network using to parse the pages:

1. Request
2. BeautifulSoap
3. Htlm5lib
4. nltk

To store and analyse the net:

1. NetworkX

To plot the data

1. D3

Step 1.5: find clusters
-------------------------------------
There are clusters? And these follow the division based on music gender?


Step 2: It's better store the data
-------------------------------------------------
I will chose a way to store and organize data, for example a DB,
like Mongo o Couch. Any information is precious, like votes or
the page reviewer


Step 3: Other data analysis
---------------------------------------
I would use also Pandas to charge the data
 to analise. After I can think about to search
 correlation between data, or to developt a method
 to sugest me some music that I don't know but that will be like.
